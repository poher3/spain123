Everyday Pancakes
Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times

The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can use different types of flour if you want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can also add fruit to the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about the same time it takes to make toast. The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking them. But that time is so short you should consider these an everyday convenience food, not a special-occasion feast. Cook this recipe a few times and it may become part of your weekly routine. (Sam Sifton)

PREPARATION
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.
Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.

They're just pancakes, people. Calm down. You don't need to use 17 different types of flour, chocolate drops only made by a hermit on the highest mountain in Switzerland on select Tuesdays in the Spring, and edible gold glitter. That's why this is titled Everyday Pancakes and not How Pretentious Can I Be Pancakes.

I halved the recipe and added finely chopped cabbage, grated carrots, finely chopped onion in small amounts so as to not overwhelm the batter. This is a fast and easy western version of okonomiyaki and can be eaten for any meal. Good alone or with sour cream, or maple syrup or your choice. Add an organic turkey sausage and there you have it, a complete meal.

If you use buttermilk (or any other acid), don't forget to add a teaspoon of baking soda!

I made the recipe as written and found that it was not as fluffy as I like it. I added two heaping tablespoons of sour cream which made them very fluffy and added a subtle flavor. I also used vanilla. As modified, I have made them several times and they are delicious and fluffy.
